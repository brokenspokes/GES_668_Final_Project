# Title of your project

A short 1-2 sentence description of your project should go here.

The README should continue with an longer description (using sub-headings to break up text as needed).

For data analysis projects, here are a few key elements to consider including in your README:

- Creator: who are you and why did you make this project? How can people get in touch with you?
- 
- Files and organization: what are the scripts and files in your repository? How are they named and organized?
- Usage: how can another user get your data and reproduce your analysis or code? Are there any restrictions on reuse?
- Acknowledgements and related projects: What work is your project inspired by or building on?

Please add a license to your repository and your README with `usethis::use_mit_license()` or another [usethis license function](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/licenses.html).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Use this to a MIT License to a project 
usethis::use_mit_license()
```

This template is a plain Markdown file. You can alternatively create a README using a RMarkdown file or a Quarto document that you render to a [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/gfm.html) (GFM) document.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Use rmarkdown to render a Rmd README file
rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd", output_format = "md_document")

# Use quarto to render a qmd README file
quarto::quarto_render("README.qmd", "gfm")
```

See [Guide to writing “readme” style metadata](https://data.research.cornell.edu/data-management/sharing/readme/) for more information on documenting reusable data publications.
