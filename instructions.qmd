This repository includes a few pieces to start:

- A folder named `R` with a blank script file named `functions.R`
- A Quarto document named `final-project-presentation.qmd` to help you make a [Quarto Revealjs presentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) (this is created using `usethis::use_github_file("bldgspatialdata/starters", "final-project-presentation.qmd")`)
- A Markdown document named `README.md` (this is a basic template created with `usethis::use_github_file("bldgspatialdata/starters", "README.md")`))

Here are the key steps for completing your final project by December 16, 2024:

- Create or rename folders and add any additional R scripts you need for your analysis
- Create one or more Quarto documents to write up any narrative component of your analysis. If you want to render all of the documents in your folder at once, you need a `_project.yml` file. This file is *not* included in the repository but [more information is available in the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html).
- Add any additional files to the repository that are required to reproduce your work
- Customize or replace the `final-project-presentation.qmd` file to create your own presentation
- Customize or replace the `README.md` file to create your own project README
- Record your brief 5 minute presentation
- Upload the meeting recording to [the shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11Dgx8m7v_mHzuStO380Wo3xhA290A5fU?usp=drive_link) making sure to include your full name in the recording file name
- Remove these instructions and any unused template files from the repository
- Commit all changes to the GitHub repository created using GitHub classroom
- Complete the final project self-assessment form (details TK)
